What I have learned(Only in a high level/ Conceptual level):
- Gate and Circuit
- Hardware Design
- Processor and Memory
- The use of ISA

Learning tips through OCW:
This was suppose to be a fun course because students have a chance to design their
own processor. But it is a too good to be true for self-learners like us.

What we can get instead is a high level concept of how hardware are implemented and
how do hardware cooperate with software. The bridge(technical term is contract)
between them is called Instruction Set Architecture(ISA). This course will help
you build a complete view of low level computer architecture. How circuit and electricity
are turned into a multi-purpose computer.
