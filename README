Words for self-learners:

MIT 6-3 curriculum is absolutely not the fastest way to learn coding. Let alone the 
MIT OCW site is incomplete, full of missing materials and somewhat outdated. A lot of
searching on Google and readings are required. So be ready if you want to get started
here.

If you can get through the pain of tackling loads and loads of issues, you can 
learn a lot of programming concepts and discipline here. Those will help you greatly
in your life as a software engineer. Also, you will be capable of teaching yourself
anything in which would definitely be an advantage in your programming job.

Lectures and textbooks can give you concepts. Then you need to write more and practice
more. In coding, especially for self-learned beginners, keep writing is the best way
to learn.

Wish for the best
