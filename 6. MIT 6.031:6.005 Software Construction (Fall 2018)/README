Learning tips through OCW:
The material here are rather complete. Lecture Readings are sufficient for you to get
the main idea of the course. Up to this point, you should be able to write single
thread modules. And you should be very good at finding knowledge online. (documentations,
StackOverflow, Wikipedia, YouTube, etc.)
