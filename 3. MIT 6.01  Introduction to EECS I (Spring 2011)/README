Learning tips through OCW:
Starting from here, self-learning start getting difficult because critique materials
are incomplete. 
As a self-learner, we rely heavily on text book explanation. I highly recommend you
to rewrite the whole StateMachine following the guidelines in the textbook. Since the 
MIT Library are private and the robot wouldn't be acessible, the hands-on module2 will
be difficult for you. The video lecture and recitation WONT be enough to understand
the entire course.
