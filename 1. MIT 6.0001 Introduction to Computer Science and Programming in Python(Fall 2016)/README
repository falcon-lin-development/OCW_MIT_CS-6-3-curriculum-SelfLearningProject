Learning tips through OCW:
The material of this course is rather complete. Video Lecture, assignments 
and text book are sufficient for a beginner to get the main purpose of the course. 
However, the assignment code are written in python2 which is not compatible with python3.
Beginners may install the python2 environment in order to get started.
