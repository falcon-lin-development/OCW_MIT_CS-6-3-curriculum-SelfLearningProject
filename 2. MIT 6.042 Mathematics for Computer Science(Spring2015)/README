Learning tips through OCW:
This course is very important for self-learners to try to follow the CS curriculum through OCW.
It provides all the fundamental mathematical tools you needs in Computer Science. 
The material of this course is rather complete.
Video Lecture, assignments, Exams, Lecture notes and In-class Questions are sufficient 
for a beginner to get the ideas off the course. Youtube and Wikipedia are handy for supplementary materials.
